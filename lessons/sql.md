# SQL Language

The statements that work with the data in a database are called **data manipulation language (DML)**. The statements that create databases and work with the objects within a database are called **data definition language(DDL)**. 

In SQL, comments can be inserted using /*... */
Single line comments can be inserted using two hyphens (--).

**SELECT** To view data from the table, use *SELECT* statement.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <table_name>
-- Here star is selector. This means all columns.
```
